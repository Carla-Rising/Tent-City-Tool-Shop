# Tent-City-Tool-Shop
I am using a lifetime of work in traditional writing, editing and publishing to create new standard products and tools for developers of a new generation of sustainable narrative media and their users / communities / audiences. 

Vision Statement: Individual writers, developers, and creative publishing teams (CPTs) will: 

1) routinely develop creative works for a variety of media applications; 
2) connect with appropriate resources and partners to complete final Narrative Product(s); 
3) find and connect with appropriate and diverse users / communities / audiences;
4) establish and protect 'copyrights' (and their successor rights) in offering Narrative Products for user / audience engagement, use, and further application; and
5) sustain the operation through existing or future wholesale/retail, cash-flow, or payment systems that fairly reward creators, developers and service-providers for their essential work, now and in the future, apart from further technological or system changes.
